      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Rutgers Christians on Campus strives to foster believers in their growth in Christ through studying and enjoying the Word of God as spiritual nourishment, establishing believers in healthy life practices, participating in regional collegiate conferences, and providing opportunities to volunteer with a national nonprofit organization to disseminate Bibles and free Christian literature. We will study the Bible with an emphasis on the original Greek and Hebrew texts in order to extract a more accurate understanding of the Bible.</p>

      <h2>Our Faith</h2>
      <p>We hold the faith that is common to all believers (Titus 1:4; Jude 3).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>The Bible</strong> is the complete divine revelation inspired word-by-word by God through the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21; 2 Tim. 3:16).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>God is uniquely one, yet triune</strong>&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (1 Tim. 2:5; Matt. 28:19).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>The Son of God</strong> even God Himself, was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus Christ (John 1:1, 14).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>Christ died</strong> on the cross for our sins, shedding His blood for our redemption (1 Pet. 2:24; Eph. 1:7).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>Christ resurrected</strong> from among the dead on the third day (1 Cor. 15:4).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>Christ ascended</strong> to the right hand of God to be the Lord of all (Acts 1:9; 2:33, 36).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>Whenever any person repents to God and believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he is regenerated</strong> (born again) and becomes a living member of the one Body of Christ (Acts 2:21; John 3:3; Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 12:5).</p>
      <p class="faith-point"><strong>Christ is coming again</strong> to receive His believers to Himself (1 Thes. 2:19).</p>
